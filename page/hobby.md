### Hobbies


My lifelong hobby is photography. I enjoy capturing moments with my iPhone 15 Pro, especially in astrophotography, macro photography, and street life. I often post my creations on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/quanghuy0497/).

I am also a passionate Formula One fan (particularly [Oracle Red Bull Racing](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en) and [Scuderia Ferrari HP](https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/formula1)) with a strong interest in the technical aspects of this motorsport, including aerodynamics, engine design, technology development, and data analysis.

In my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy, such as Dune, The Three-Body Problem, A Song of Ice and Fire, and The Lord of the Rings. I also like watching their film and TV adaptations, and I reread The Godfather every year.
